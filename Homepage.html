            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I am a 29 year-old resident of Salt Lake City. I have always been interested <br>
            in learning to code. I tried to join VSchool a few years ago but got scared and <br>
            backed out at the last minute. This time, I am fully committed and very eager to learn!</p>
